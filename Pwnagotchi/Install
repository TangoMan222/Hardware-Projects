  -Open "device manager" and monitor for a new "USB Serial Device"
  -If not your first boot-up:
      -after a few seconds, you will see a new Ethernet interface on your host computer
  -If you have never booted your Pwnagotchi before:
      -it will take a few minutes to boot up and/or become visible or responsive.
      -DO NOT INTERRUPT YOUR PWNAGOTCHI DURING THIS PROCESS (RSA keys are being generated and losing power could cause them to become corrupt)

      -IP: 10.0.0.1
      -Netmask: 255.255.255.0
      -Gateway: 10.0.0.1
      -DNS (if required): 8.8.8.8
  -you can now ping your pi at 10.0.0.2
